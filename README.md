# Introduction To Robotics (2022-2023)
Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files.

## Homework 1
### Components:
* RGB led
* 3 potentiometers
* 3 resistors
* wires

### Technical Task
Use a separate potentiometer in controlling each of the color of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue). The control must be done with digital electronics.

### Implementation details
The values read from each potentiometer range from 0 to 1023, and each color of the led has values between between 0 and 255. Therefore we need to map the values from the potentiometer to those of the led.
